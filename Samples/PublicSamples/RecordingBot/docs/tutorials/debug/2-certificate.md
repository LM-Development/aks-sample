# Retrieve Certificate from Let's Encrypt

In this step we will use Certbot to retreive a certificate from Let's Encrypt with a valid trust
chain.

## Generate Certificate

In the first step, we execute the following command in a privileged environment to create the
certificate and start the signing request to Letâ€™s Encrypt.

``` pwsh
certbot certonly --manual --preferred-challenges dns -d "recordingbot-local.example.com"
```

The output should look similar to:

``` text
Saving debug log to C:\Certbot\log\letsencrypt.log
Enter email address (used for urgent renewal and security notices)
 (Enter 'c' to cancel):
```

Certbot asks for our email address for security alerts and urgent renewal messages. We enter an
email address that we want to use for this and confirm this address by pressing Enter.

The next output we should see is:

``` text
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Please read the Terms of Service at
https://letsencrypt.org/documents/LE-SA-v1.4-April-3-2024.pdf. You must agree in
order to register with the ACME server. Do you agree?
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
(Y)es/(N)o:
```

As stated in the output, we need to accept the the terms of service. Similar to before, we enter our
answer (`y`) and press Enter.

The next output we should see is:

``` text
- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
Would you be willing, once your first certificate is successfully issued, to
share your email address with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a founding
partner of the Let's Encrypt project and the non-profit organization that
develops Certbot? We'd like to send you email about our work encrypting the web,
EFF news, campaigns, and ways to support digital freedom.

(Y)es/(N)o:
```

Certbot asks us if we want to share our email address with a Let's Encrypt partner. If we want to,
we can type `y` and confirm our answer by pressing Enter. If we don't want to, we can refuse by
typing `n` and confirming our answer with Enter.

The next output we should see is:

``` text

Please deploy a DNS TXT record under the name:

_acme-challenge.recordingbot-local.example.com.

with the following value:

sp5cMJWgqECk7DPy9kvVZ80s2dkI9IEUDVy8Il8St5o

Before continuing, verify the TXT record has been deployed. Depending on the DNS
provider, this may take some time, from a few seconds to multiple minutes. You can
check if it has finished deploying with aid of online tools, such as the Google
Admin Toolbox: https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/dig/#TXT/_acme-challenge.recordingbot-local.example.com.
Look for one or more bolded line(s) below the line ';ANSWER'. It should show the
value(s) you've just added.

Press Enter to Continue
```

> [!NOTE]  
> If you already used Certbot previously, it should directly show the last output.

## Set DNS TXT Entry for ACME challenge

As the output asks us todo, we need to create a TXT record on our domain for validation. Check how
to do it with your DNS provider. After we created the TXT record `_acme-challenge.recordingbot-local.example.com`
should contain the value provided by certbot `sp5cMJWgqECk7DPy9kvVZ80s2dkI9IEUDVy8Il8St5o`. To check
if that is the case we can use the Google Admin Toolbox.

If we can retreive the TXT record from the Google admin Toolbox(see screenshot above) we can
continue with retrieving the certificate.

## Retrieve Certificate

To continue retrieving the certificate with Certbot, we go back to our Certbot Terminal and press
Enter to confirm that we have completed the setup of the DNS challenge.

The resulting output should look similar to:

``` text
Successfully received certificate.
Certificate is saved at: C:\Certbot\live\recordingbot-local.example.com\fullchain.pem
Key is saved at:         C:\Certbot\live\recordingbot-local.example.com\privkey.pem
This certificate expires on 2024-10-13.
These files will be updated when the certificate renews.

NEXT STEPS:
- This certificate will not be renewed automatically. Autorenewal of --manual certificates requires the use of an authentication hook script (--manual-auth-hook) but one was not provided. To renew this certificate, repeat this same certbot command before the certificate's expiry date.

```

> [!TIP]
> The TXT DNS Record can be deleted now.

Note down the paths, where the key and the certificate is stored, as we need them in the next step.
In our example this is _C:\Certbot\live\recordingbot-local.example.com\fullchain.pem_ and
_C:\Certbot\live\recordingbot-local.example.com\privkey.pem_.

> [!NOTE]  
> The output also displays a certificate expiration date. The steps to retrieve a certificate must
> be performed again by this date at the latest, but can be performed earlier. If the certificate
> expires it is not valid anymore and debugging locally doesn't work anymore.
